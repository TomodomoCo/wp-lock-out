# WP Lock Out

When activated, WP Lock Out lets you prevent users from logging into the site, and blocks access to the admin area for logged in non-admin-level users (after they hard-refresh).

On the login page, the login form will be hidden. To display the form and complete the login, enter the Konami code (up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a-enter).

Special thanks to @tommcfarlin for his [Konami Code for jQuery](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/konami-code) script.
